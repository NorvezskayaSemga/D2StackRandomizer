nRaces Number of races

PlayersRaces Player races. Different and playable. Delimiter - ; (H;U;L;E;C;R or Humans;Undead;Legions;Elves;Clans;Random)/nIn this case, the first race in the list will be on the first location, the second on the second, etc./nIf races less than nRaces, then random will be added, if more, then a random selection will be made from the list/nNothing, if a random selection is needed

StartGold Initial gold supply
StartMana Initial race mana supply

SpellsMaxLevel Maximum spell level in the capital

ApplySymmetry Whether to apply symmetry operations

SymmetryClass -1 - random symmetry, if .ApplySymmetry = True, ignored if .ApplySymmetry = False./nFor two races: 0 - L2, 1 - xM, 2 - yM, 3 - xy1M, 4 - xy2M./nFor four races: 0 - L4, 1 - xM+yM, 2 - xy1M+xy2M./nL2 - turn 180 degrees around the axis located in the center of the map/nL4 - rotate 90 degrees around the axis located in the center of the map. Only for square maps/nxM - reflection in a plane parallel to the Ox axis and passing through the center of the map/nyM - reflection in a plane parallel to the Oy axis and passing through the center of the map/nxy1M - reflection in a plane parallel to the diagonal {x, y}, and passing through the center of the map. For square maps only/nxy2M - reflection in a plane parallel to the diagonal {-x, y} and passing through the center of the map. For square maps only

xSize Right border of the map (for example, if we generate a 24x48 map, then write 24 here)
ySize Upper border of the map (for example, if we generate a 24x48 map, then we write 48 here)

RaceLocsDistTolerance Generator will arrange locations with capitals so that for each location the following condition is met:/nR1*(1+RaceLocsDistTolerance)>=R2, with R2>R1, where R1 and R2 are the distance to the two nearest locations with capitals

PassageCreationChance Determines the freedom of movement around the map./n0 - the generator does not try to connect locations,/n1 - generator will connect each location with each neighboring one (but tries not to connect the starting ones in any case)

minPassWidth Minimum width of passages between locations
minPassDist Minimum distance between passages

AddGuardsBetweenLocations Whether to place guardians of aisles between locations
PassGuardsPowerMultiplicator Power multiplier of guards of passages between locations
ObjectGuardsPowerMultiplicator Visited object guards power multiplier

LocExpRatio Ratio of the maximum experience gained for clearing a average-sized location to the minimum./nThe further the location is from the nearest capital and the closer to the center, the more experience for clearing it

Wealth Neutral loot cost multiplier

WaterAmount Amount of water on the map. 0 - no water, 1 - a lot
RoadsAmount Amount of roads on the map. 0 - no roads, 1 - maximum number
ForestAmount Amount of forest on the map. 0 - no forest, 1 - maximum amount

posX X coordinate of the location on the map (the number will be multiplied by the map size in X)
